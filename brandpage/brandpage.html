              One of the most popular earring types for men is the stud
              earrings. When stud earrings are worn, they appear to be
              free-floating on the ear. Stud earrings follow a simple and subtle
              design. Jewelry makers craft stud earrings by combining a thin rod
              and an adornment.

              Dangling earrings were sent down the runway at numerous men's wear

              Gucci. ... It's for men who aren't afraid of experimenting with
              their look and will probably have enlightened views on gender
              roles, or at least be comfortable enough with their own
              sexuality.‚Äù
